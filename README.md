## Applied Concurrency in Go

### HTTP request/response cycle

On the internet, information is mostly exchanged via HTTP. The exchange begins with the client sending out an HTTP
request to the server to ask for information. If the server recognizes the request, it begins processing it by invoking
any backend code required to fulfill the request. The invoked functions are typically called _request handlers_. Once
the backend processing completes, the server finishes the information exchange by wrapping the information into an HTTP
response and sending it back to the client.

### Concurrency vs. Parallelism

**Parallel** events or tasks execute simultaneously and independently. True parallel events require multiple CPUs. Each
task runs in isolation from each other and uses all the resources it needs to accomplish its objective.

**Concurrent** tasks or events are interleaving and can happen in any given order. It is a non-deterministic way of
achieving multiple tasks. Concurrent tasks seem to happen simultaneously while in actual sense, they are being swapped
very quickly.

#### Examples of concurrent tasks in a typical computer

1. Running of background tasks for updates
2. Running the operating system
3. Writing information to the disk
4. Reading information from the disk
5. Swapping between multiple active applications

| Concurrency   | Parallelism   |
|---|---|
|  Dealing with a lot of things at once | Doing a lot of things at once   |
| Only a single thing is done at a time  |  Multiple things are done at the same time |
| Other new tasks are run during the idle periods of other running tasks  |  The tasks run independently and do not influence each other |

### The Go Runtime

In Go, concurrent tasks are called _goroutines_. Other programming languages have a similar concept called _threads_,
but goroutines require **_less computer memory_** than threads, and _**less time to start up and stop**_, meaning you
can run more goroutines at once.

#### Goroutines Exercise

In executing the `serialtaskexecution` without goroutines, the following output was realized:

- Linear serial task execution

````text
Done making hotel reservation.
Done booking flight tickets.
Done ordering a dress.
Done paying Credit Card bills.
Wrote 1/3rd of the mail.
Wrote 2/3rds of the mail.
Done writing the mail.
Listened to 10 minutes of audio book.
Done listening to audio book.
````

- Serial task execution using `goroutines`

However, when goroutines was used, the following output was realized:

````text
Done making hotel reservation.
Done booking flight tickets.
Done ordering a dress.
Done paying Credit Card bills.
Wrote 1/3rd of the mail.
Listened to 10 minutes of audio book.
````

This is because `goroutines` are not waited upon. The code in the `main` function continues executing and once the
control flow reaches the end of the main function, the program ends.

- Task execution using `sync.waitGroup`

When a `waitGroup` was used, the following output was realized (one of the possible ones).
`continueWritingMail1` and `continueWritingMail2` were executed at the end after `listenToAudioBook`
and `continueListeningToAudioBook`

```text
Done making hotel reservation
Done booking flight tickets
Done ordering a dress
Done paying Credit Card bills
Wrote 1/3rd of the mail.
Listened to 10 minutes of audio book.
Done listening to audio book.
Wrote 2/3rds of the mail.
Done writing the mail.
```

Adding `go` in-front of `task(&waitGroup)` enables the achievement of maximum concurrency by letting Go runtime
determine the order of execution of the tasks.

### Goroutines

These are independently executing functions that run on top of normal threads but lighter. They are therefore sometimes
referred to as `lightweight threads`.

1. They are independently executing functions
2. Sometimes referred to as lightweight threads
3. Run on top of threads
4. Outnumber threads by orders of magnitude
5. Runtime optimally schedules goroutines

### Methods of the sync.WaitGroup

The `sync` package provides locks and synchronization primitives for use in concurrent programming. The WaitGroup is
used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish.

```go
func (wg *WaitGroup) Add(delta int)
func (wg *WaitGroup) Done()
func (wg *WaitGroup) Wait()
```

- `Add` adds a given number to the inner counter
- `Done` decrements the counter by 1 and is used to denote the completion of a goroutine
- `Wait` blocks the goroutine from which it is invoked until the counter reaches zero

NB: A good practice is to invoke the `Done` method as a deferred call at the beginning of the function to ensure it is
called.

### Race conditions

- Race conditions occur when multiple goroutines read and write shared data without synchronization mechanisms.
- Race conditions create inconsistent results
- Problems often occur with a `check-then-act` operation.
- Go toolchain has a built-in race detector.

```text
go run -race server.go
```

### Synchronization primitives in Go

- Channels
- Mutexes
- r/w mutexes
- atomic operations

#### The sync.Map

- Safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines
- Equivalent to a safe ```map[interface{}]interface{}```
- The zero value is empty and ready for use
- Incurs [performance](https://medium.com/@deckarep/the-new-kid-in-town-gos-sync-map-de24a6bf7c2c) overhead and should
  only be used as necessary

##### Using the sync.Map

```go
func (m *Map) Load(key interface{}) (value interface{}, ok bool)
func (m *Map) Store(key, value interface{})
func (m *Map) Range(f func (key, value interface{}) bool)
```

- The `Load` method reads an existing item from the map and returns nil and false when value does not exist
- The `Store` method inserts or updates (upserts) a new key value pair
- The `Range` method which takes in a function and sequentially calls it for all the values in the map

#### The sync.Mutex

The Mutex is initialized unlocked using `var m sync.Mutex`

```go
func (m *Mutex) Lock()
func (m *Mutex) Unlock()
```

The `Lock` method locks the Mutex and will block until the Mutex is in an unlocked state The `Unlock` method unlocks the
Mutex and allows it to be used by another goroutine

### Channels

- The value proposition of `channels` in Go is that there is no need to pass values to the shared context of the main
  function. The channel acts as a pass-through.
- Channels is Go are first-class citizens and therefore can be used without importing any extra packages.
- The channel operator is the arrow operator `<-`.
- Channels are associated with a type and only the declared data type can be transported in them. The syntax to declare
  a channel of type T is ```ch := make(chan T```
- The zero value of channels is `nil`.
- Sending to a channel is done with `ch <- data`; the arrow points into the channel as data travels into it.
- Receiving is done with `data := <- ch` ; the arrow points away from the channel as data travels out of it.
- Channels send and receive operations are blocking; meaning that code execution will stop until the send or receive
  operation is successfully completed.
