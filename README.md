## Applied Concurrency in Go

### HTTP request/response cycle

On the internet, information is mostly exchanged via HTTP. The exchange begins with the client sending out an HTTP
request to the server to ask for information. If the server recognizes the request, it begins processing it by invoking
any backend code required to fulfill the request. The invoked functions are typically called _request handlers_. Once
the backend processing completes, the server finishes the information exchange by wrapping the information into an HTTP
response and sending it back to the client.

### Concurrency vs. Parallelism

**Parallel** events or tasks execute simultaneously and independently. True parallel events require multiple CPUs. Each
task runs in isolation from each other and uses all the resources it needs to accomplish its objective.

**Concurrent** tasks or events are interleaving and can happen in any given order. It is a non-deterministic way of
achieving multiple tasks. Concurrent tasks seem to happen simultaneously while in actual sense, they are being swapped
very quickly.

#### Examples of concurrent tasks in a typical computer

1. Running of background tasks for updates
2. Running the operating system
3. Writing information to the disk
4. Reading information from the disk
5. Swapping between multiple active applications

| Concurrency   | Parallelism   |
|---|---|
|  Dealing with a lot of things at once | Doing a lot of things at once   |
| Only a single thing is done at a time  |  Multiple things are done at the same time |
| Other new tasks are run during the idle periods of other running tasks  |  The tasks run independently and do not influence each other |

### The Go Runtime

In Go, concurrent tasks are called _goroutines_. Other programming languages have a similar concept called _threads_,
but goroutines require **_less computer memory_** than threads, and _**less time to start up and stop**_, meaning you
can run more goroutines at once.
